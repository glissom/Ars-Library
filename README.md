XML based data and human friendly formatting for Ars Magica spells

The data for this consists partially of spells from Ars Magica 5th Edition which are copyright Atlas Games.
Also included will be spells developed from one or more Sagas. Were each spell comes from is indicated in the source element.

So far the plan is to have some number of XML files. Either one big one or split by source (book/saga)
A Schema to describe the formatting
Then a XSLT document to organise the data for display and a CSS file to make it pretty.
